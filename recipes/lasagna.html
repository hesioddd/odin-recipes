            <li>1 egg</li>

            <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Gather all your ingredients.</li>
            <li>2. Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a DUtch over over
                medium heat until well-browned.</li>
            <li>3. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.
                Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 tablespoon salt,
                Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about
                1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>4. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
                noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse
                with cold water.</li>
            <li>5. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons
                of parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>6. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>7. To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 
                9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce,
                overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture.
                Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat
            sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>8. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
                Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray
                or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>9. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and
                bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>10. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ul>
